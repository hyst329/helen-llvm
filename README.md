# helen-llvm
Helen language compiler and interpreter based on LLVM.

## How to build
The best way to do this is using Clang or GCC (on Windows - via Cygwin/MSYS2)

Dependencies
* Boost (especially `program_options` library, for the main interface)
* LLVM (for the language infrastructure)
* Flex & Bison (for the lexer and parser)
